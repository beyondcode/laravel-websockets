# Laravel WebSockets ðŸ›°

WebSockets for Laravel. Done right.

Laravel WebSockets is a package for Laravel that will get your application started with WebSockets in no-time! It has a drop-in Pusher API replacement, has a debug dashboard, realtime statistics and even allows you to create custom WebSocket controllers.

Once installed, you can start it with one simple command:

```php
php artisan websockets:serve
```

If you want to know how all of it works under the hood, we wrote an in-depth [blogpost](https://murze.be/introducing-laravel-websockets-an-easy-to-use-websocket-server-implemented-in-php) about it.

To help you get started, you can also take a look at the [demo repository](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-websockets-demo), that implements a basic Chat built with this package.
